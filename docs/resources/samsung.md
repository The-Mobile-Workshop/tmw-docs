# Resources & Tools

## :material-download:Firmware downloads
Reliable Sites for firmware downloads

- [Samfw.com (Recommended)](https://samfw.com/) |
  Download Samsung firmware at max speed and for free. <br>
  They seem to also provide "Combination" (factory testing?) firmware downloads.

- [Sfirmware.com](https://sfirmware.com/)
- [Sammobile.com](https://www.sammobile.com/firmwares/) | Please for fucks sake stop using this.<br>
  Requires signup + forces you to buy their PrEmIuM to download certain older firmware.

## :material-flash:Flashing tools / Download Mode tools
- [Samsung Odin (samsungodin.com)](https://samsungodin.com/)
- [Samsung Odin (samfw.com) (Recommended)](https://samfw.com/blog/download-odin-all-version) |
  A Windows only flashing tool that pretty much works to near universal levels of compatibility.
  The Samfw.com site is providing much more "safer" downloads and they also have a patched one for older Samsung devices.

- [Heimdall](https://glassechidna.com.au/heimdall/) |
  Heimdall is a cross plaform Samsung flashing tool that has a bit of a struggle with compatibility. Some devices work, others don't.

- [Heimdall Fuzz](https://github.com/nitayart/heimdall_fuzz) |
  Same as above except it has a feature for being able to send raw packets to the device (for fuzzing/hacking).

- [Thor (Early WIP)](https://github.com/Samsung-Loki/Thor) |
  No idea. All we know its a WIP flashing tool claiming to have more features than Odin & Heimdall.

## :material-upload:Upload Mode / ARM9 Mode tools
- [SUC (Samsung Upload Client)](https://github.com/bkerler/sboot_dump) |
  A tool to dump RAM using Samsung Upload Mode.<br>
  We recommend you use this tool as S-Boot dump is too old.

- [S-Boot dump](https://github.com/nitayart/sboot_dump) |
  The Original tool for the job which doesnt really work all to well.
